This is a simple registration that connects the frontend to the backend. I built this code **using React** with NodeJS. 

## Getting Started 
  - You will first have to make sure you have my other repository installed. Repository and instructions are here: 
https://github.com/AliBee87/MSSE661MongoAPI
  - Then you will have to enter `npm run dev` to get the server going. 

## To Run This Project
 First, ensure you have npm installed.

 Then, in your terminal, input 

 ```
  npx create-react-app [name]
 ```

 Then, enter 

 ```
 cd [name]
 ```

 And then, 

 ```
 code .
 ```

 To get into the file. 

 
 You'll need to make sure you have the following packages installed: 
 
   ```
    @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
   
    @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
    
    @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
    
    axios
   ```
  
  To install, enter `npm i` and the package in your terminal.
   
  Then, to run, go to the file location, then enter `npm start` in your terminal. Thanks for checking out my work!
